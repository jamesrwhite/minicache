# minicached

minicached is a work in progress in-memory caching system
featuring a similar [text based protocol](https://github.com/memcached/memcached/blob/master/doc/protocol.txt)
to [memcached](http://memcached.org/) and should be usable from most existing memcached libraries. The eventual
goal being to have a similar feature set to memcached but also to support prefix based wildcards on keys so you can do things
like delete all keys that start with `user` by doing `delete user*`.

## Commands implemented

- get
- set
- delete
- flush_all
- quit
